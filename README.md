# Weather-App
The website provides users with the current weather conditions in their location, including temperature and a description of the weather. Users can also search for any city to obtain the current weather and corresponding information for that city.
# Targets Accomplished
1.Retrieving weather data for a specified location via an API request.
2.Retrieving the present-day weather for a specified location.
# Tech Used
1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS
# Issues faced
Determining the method to connect the data received in the response to the necessary components for accurate display. I attempted to implement the Google Maps autocomplete feature to provide suggestions as the user types, aiming to assist the user, but encountered difficulty in its implementation.
# Area of Improvement
Presently, the website only provides weather information when the user enters the correct spelling of the location. It lacks the capability to notify the user if there's an error or spelling mistake while typing the location. To address this issue, informing the user about incorrect or misspelled locations, allowing them to correct mistakes is essential. Alternatively, incorporating an autocomplete feature would ensure accurate responses every time. Additionally, enhancing the website's styling for improved responsiveness and aesthetics is necessary. Customizing the website's appearance based on the weather conditions would further enhance its functionality and user experience.
# Learnings
During the development of this project, I gained knowledge about APIs and their utilization.
